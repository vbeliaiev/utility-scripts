# Regular expressions #
often called regex, define patterns for matching strings of text. They use a mix of literal characters and special metacharacters to search, validate, or manipulate data efficiently across programming languages and tools.

## Basic Example ##
The pattern \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4} matches US phone numbers like "123-45-6789", where \d denotes digits and {n} specifies repetitions. Test patterns in tools like regex101.com for practice.
