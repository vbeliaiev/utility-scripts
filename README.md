# utility-scripts
This repository is intended for storing various scripts that simplify development tasks. Currently, it contains a single script that adds `# frozen_string_literal: true` to Ruby files that are missing it. You can also find Rails application templates to quickly configure your application.

## ruby_frozen_literal.sh

The purpose of this script is to add the missing `# frozen_string_literal: true` headers to Ruby files. It can work with both individual files and directories, recursively adding the header wherever it is missing.

See more details in the [ruby_frozen_literal.md](ruby_frozen_literal/ruby_frozen_literal.md) file.


## Rails application templates

When starting a new Rails project, it's important to quickly and efficiently set up the basic environment. In this section, Iâ€™ll explore the available options for generating a new application and suggest an optimal set of commands to minimize routine configuration.

See more details in the [rails_application_templates.md](rails_application_templates/rails_application_templates.md) file.
